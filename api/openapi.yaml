        Use this method to create a new segment. You create segments to target a subset of your contacts that meet your specific criteria for a marketing campaign. The segment `name` must be unique. The `segment_criteria` requires single-string escaped JSON. Constant Contact uses the contact data that you specify in the `segment_criteria` to evaluate and identify the contacts you want to target. Contact data can be grouped from different data sources, including:

          -  **`tracking`**: Supports **or** and **and** groups.


          -  **`contact`**: Supports **or** and **and** groups.


          -  **`list_membership`**: Supports **or** groups.

          -  **`tags`**: Supports **or** groups.

        If you do not specify `list_membership` as criteria, Constant Contact evaluates all contacts in your account. To avoid returning a 400 error response, when specifying the `segment_criteria` do not request more than 500 email campaigns or a date range greater than 1825 days (5 years) be evaluated.

        This GET call retrieves a collection of cross-referenced contact sequence IDs (`id` used in the V2 API) and UUIDs (`contact_id` used in the V3 API). This endpoint is intended for developers who have an existing V2 API integration, and are migrating their users to a new V3 API integration. The V2 and V3 APIs use different resource ID formats. Use the `sequence_ids` query parameter to specify a set of comma delimited V2 contacts ids to cross-referenced with their V3 `contact_ids`. See [Migrating to V3](/api_guide/migration_overview.html) to learn more.

        Use this method to update an email campaign activity by including the complete email campaign activity with your changes in the request body. The request body requires the `from_name`, `from_email`, `reply_to_email`, and `subject` properties.

        You can only update email campaign activities that have the `primary_email` role and that are in `DRAFT` or `Done` status.
        When you use a PUT method to update a resource, the V3 API overwrites any properties that are missing in the request body. However, the V3 API does not overwrite subresources that you omit in the request body or missing properties in subresources. This method considers `physical_address_in_footer`, `document_properties`, `html_content`, and `permalink_url` subresources of the email campaign activity.

        Use this method to send a test email to specific email addresses. Test emails allow you to verify how the email campaign activity will look before you send it to contacts. This method uses the `email_addresses` array in the request body to determine the recipients of the test email. The test email does not process any dynamic content in the email campaign activity. Dynamic content includes contact and custom field variables.

        You can send up to 50 test emails each day. Each recipient you add to the `email_addresses` array in the request body counts towards this limit. Successfully sending a test email returns a 204 response code without a response body.
